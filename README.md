- 👋 Hi, I’m @rnjon
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything I can about servers, coding, and informatics. I have learned a lot of Linux commands and started to use my own servers for my website. This is a small accomplishment for many of you, but for me it is a source of pride. Only a couple of months ago, I knew Linux was a funny word that the IT guys at the hospital knew.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about psychiatry and therapeutic communication skills but I would rather be learning to code, I have begun learning javascript. My psychiatric nurse practitioner grad school program takes up a lot of time. Please be patient with me, but know that I am attentive and I learn very quickly.
- 🧠👨‍💻 I am trying to find my best options for learning to code. Can anyone recommend an online program that I can apply to for after I graduate?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something in the future, but I am still a newbie!
