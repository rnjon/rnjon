- 👋 Hi, I’m @rnjon
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything I can about servers, coding, and informatics. I have learned a lot of Linux commands.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about psychiatry and therapeutic communication skills but I would rather be learning to code, I have begun learning javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something in the future, but I am still a newbie!
- 📫 You can reach me at Jon@RNJon.com
